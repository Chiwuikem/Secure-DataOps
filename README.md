# Secure DataOps Pipeline

## Overview
The Secure DataOps Pipeline is an end-to-end, real-time data streaming system that ingests live data from public APIs, processes it through AWS services, detects anomalies, and visualizes results in an interactive dashboard.  
This project blends software engineering, cybersecurity, and data engineering practices to demonstrate modern, production-ready architecture.

## Features
- Real-Time Data Streaming using AWS Kinesis for high-volume ingestion.
- Data Storage in AWS S3 for raw data and Snowflake/PostgreSQL for structured analytics.
- Anomaly Detection powered by Python algorithms to flag suspicious patterns in near real-time.
- Security Integration with SIEM logging via Elasticsearch for monitoring and alerting.
- Interactive Dashboard built with React.js to visualize live metrics and security alerts.
- Automated CI/CD deployment pipeline with Docker and GitHub Actions.
